                <p class="lead">Choosing the perfect grinder can be quite the journey,
                    but it will transform your coffee experience.</p>
                <p>If you have never had the opportunity to try freshly ground coffee,
                    you may be missing out on a ton of flavor. This is because coffee
                    begins to "off gas" the second it leaves the roaster, and within
                    the first few hours or even days the coffee's flavor improves.
                    At this point the coffee has had enough time to rest and you will
                    enjoy its best flavors for around 5-7 days after this point.
                    However, when coffee is ground directly after roasting, it's
                    surface area is drastically increased, leading to a much quicker
                    off gassing time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to this quicker off gassing it is often recommended that coffee
                    is ground directly before its use. This will greatly improve both
                    depth of flavor one will experience in their cup.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    In addition to grinding coffee just before use, you should also plan
                    to store your coffee in an air tight container. Personally I prefer
                    Mason jars, but any container will do.

                <p>The Baratza Encore is one of the most popular grinders for home use,
                    offering a wide range of grind setttings, although it does not
                    support espresso out of the box. It is a more expensive grinder,
                    but Baratza offers great support, and their products are known
                    to last a long time. </p><p>The Encore is on the more expensive side,
                    but don't feel discourged, there are plenty of less expensive
                    options that will still give you great resutls. </p>
                <h2><a href="https://a.co/d/3aKKodw">Cuisinart Supreme Grind</a></h2>
                <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FO+YCV+eL._AC_SL1175_.jpg" class="h-96 pl-4" />
                <p>The Cuisinart Supreme Grind is a very affordable grinder that is
                    perfect for home use. It even includes a built in timer function
                    that will stop grinding at the perfect time. It can be found at
                    Walmart or online at Amazon. </p>
                <h2><a href="https://a.co/d/c00fzLc">Hario Ceramic Coffee Mill</a></h2>
                <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eBibyUbvL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" class="h-96 pl-4"/>
                <p>Lastly we have the Hario hand grinder. This is a cheaper option,
                    that can also be very useful for camping trips, or other situations
                    where you may not have power. Hand grinders do take quite a bit
                    of work to use, but they are much more quiet, especially first
                    thing in the morning.</p>

                <p>Hopefully this list is a good starting point for choosing your
                    own coffee grinder. If you have any questions of course feel
                    free to reach out.</p>
